<p> Before you begin this study, let&#39;s quickly test how far away you are sitting. You might know that vision tests at a doctor&#39;s practice often involve chinrests, the doctor basically asks you to sit away from a screen in a specific distance. We do this here with a <b>virtual chinrest</b>. </p>

	<em><b>Please use both eyes for the following task.</b></em> First, you will see a screen (like the one in the image below) showing a <b>black dot</b> in the middle of the screen, with a group of circles displayed on either the <span class=""bolded-blue"">left</span> or <span class=""bolded-blue"">right</span> of the black dot for 150 ms. <span class=""bolded-blue"">Please make sure to focus on the black dot all the time!</span>

	Your task is to identify whether the opening of the <b class=""bolded-blue"">center circle</b> is upward by pressing UP or downward by pressing DOWN on your keyboard. The opening of the circle will only be upward or downward, not towards left or right.
